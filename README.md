# Sports Betting Data Pipeline & Analytics Dashboard README

## Project Description

This project implements an end-to-end data pipeline and interactive analytics dashboard focused on sports betting markets. The pipeline collects raw data from multiple public APIs, cleans and normalizes the data, stores it in a structured relational database, and exposes the processed data through an interactive web dashboard.

The dashboard enables exploratory analysis of betting odds, implied probabilities, game outcomes, and bookmaker behavior across seasons. The project emphasizes reproducibility, transparency, and clear data documentation, following best practices for data science pipelines.

The jupyter file is the file I used initially to create the dash app and all of the initial data cleaning and acquiring the data from the APIs. The flask app file is the file I used to host on python anywhere for the website. 

The code files consist of:
- A data ingestion and transformation pipeline
- A SQLite relational database with documented schema
- A Flask + Dash web application for visualization and analysis

## Generative AI Use Statement

Generative AI tools were used in the following limited and supportive ways:
- Assisting with the creation of the Dash application and its corresponding Flask backend
- Reviewing and proofreading the *Data in Brief* document
- Reviewing and proofreading the *First Project Check-In* document

All data collection logic, data processing, database design, analysis, visualizations, and overall system architecture were created by me.
